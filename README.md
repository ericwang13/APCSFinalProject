**Development Log**

1. Initialized IntelliJ JavaFX Project. Mostly boilerplate code so far, excluding some small formatting changes and FXML update via SceneBuilder

2. Added JavaFX SDK and OpenCV jar/dll dependancies. This was a particularly hard step becuase there is pretty limited documentation on loading DLLs into java.library.path, eventually figured it out with jvm arguments
